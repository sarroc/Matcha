    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>
      Matcha originated in China but the production of compressed tea, the raw
      material for matcha, was banned in China in the 14th century.[9] Shade
      growing was invented in Japan in the 16th century[10] and most matcha is
      produced there today.[11] The traditional Japanese tea ceremony, typically
      known as chanoyu (茶の湯) or sadō/chadō (茶道), centers on the
      preparation, serving and drinking of matcha as hot tea, and embodies a
      meditative and spiritual practice.
    </p>
    <h3>In Japanese ceremony</h3>
    <p>
      Drinking koicha is considered as the main part of Japanese tea
      ceremony,[32] while drinking usucha is considered as a sub part of it.[33]
      In the ceremonies, matcha is stored and made using a special teaware
      called chaki. Specifically, matcha for koicha and usucha are stored in
      special containers, chaire (茶入) and natsume (棗), respectively. Prior to
      use, the matcha can be sifted through a sieve to reduce clumps.[34] Matcha
      is scooped out from these containers by chashaku (茶杓), a traditional
      Japanese spoon. Matcha and hot water are then put in a chawan (茶碗), the
      bowl, and stirred with chasen (茶筅), a whisk usually made from bamboo. It
      is drunk from the chawan. One drinks matcha after finishing (not during)
      eating sweets in order to allow a prolonged taste of the matcha.

    <h3>Benefits of Green Tea Matcha</h3>
    <h4>1.ENERGY WITHOUT THE ANXIETY, CRASH OR JITTERS</h4>
    <p>
      The combination of caffeine with l-theanine in matcha green tea provides a
      stable and extended boost of energy without the anxious jitters or side
      effects like you might have previously experienced with coffee and energy
      drinks. The caffeine will gently pick you up, provide you with an extended
      energy boost and then will let you softly back down to earth. HERE'S THE
      SECRET: Matcha is 100% powdered green tea that gives you clean energy
      without excessive caffeine, sugar content and unknown chemicals. But don't
      worry, one scoop of Tenzo Matcha still contains same caffeine as one shot
      of espresso, but the energy lasts for hours!
    </p>
    <h4>2.MATCHA FOR FOCUS</h4>
    <p>
      Some things simply require a lot of thought. The combination of caffeine
      and l-theanine do wonders for concentration* (11). L-theanine boosts the
      production of alpha waves in the brain. These alpha waves encourage
      relaxation and induce a profound feeling of mental clarity and a more
      alert state of mind - the same mental state can be found in meditation and
      yoga practice. You know what you’re doing. Matcha is here to make sure
      everybody else does, too.
    </p>
    <h4>3. MATCHA: GREAT FOR IMMUNITY</h4>
    <p>
      Concerts are sick. Your friend’s new mixtape is sick. Being sick, however,
      is not sick. Matcha green tea Fortifies the immune system and limits the
      invasion and growth of viruses and bacteria in the body. The special
      catechin antioxidant called EGCg is effective in fighting and protecting
      the body against various bacterial and viral infections* (21). EGCg binds
      to cells in the body and inhibits the growth of many disease-causing
      microorganisms including influenza A virus, Hepatitis Virus, Herpes Virus,
      and the bacteria that causes Strep Throat.
    </p>
    <h4>4. MATCHA BURNS CALORIES</h4>
    <p>
      Want to go the extra mile? Try adding matcha to your weight loss program
      and see what happens. EGCg and caffeine work together to naturally boost
      your metabolism and increase the number of calories you burn on a daily
      basis. Matcha green tea utilizes fat as an energy source. Green tea
      catechins activate the body’s thermogenic fat burning activity* (13). In a
      12-week study, it was found that ingesting green tea led to a significant
      reduction in BMI, waist circumference, body fat mass, and subcutaneous fat
      area of healthy Japanese men and women* (14). Bet your last workout wasn’t
      that easy!
    </p>
    <h4>5. MATCHA MAY IMPROVE HEART HEALTH</h4>
    <p>
      Stay calm for this: Matcha green tea can help protect you from a heart
      attack or stroke* – and matcha green tea powder may be much more effective
      than steeped green tea when it comes to heart health (20). Introducing
      matcha green tea into your regular diet may significantly lower your risk
      of having a stroke or heart attack. Of course, matcha isn’t all you need
      for a healthy heart. Experts recommend a healthy and regular eating
      pattern that includes whole grains, fruits and vegetables, fish, and foods
      that are low in sugar, fat, sodium and cholesterol. Eating right and
      exercise are key to a healthy heart!
    </p>
    <h4>6. MATCHA MAKES YOU SMARTER</h4>
    <p>
      One study looked at how people performed on a series of tasks designed to
      measure brain performance. Some participants consumed either matcha tea or
      a bar containing 4 grams of matcha, while the control group consumed a
      placebo tea or bar (22). The participants performed a set of cognitive
      tests assessing attention, information processing, working memory, and
      episodic memory (23) (24). The researchers found that matcha caused
      improvements in attention, reaction time and memory, compared to the
      placebo*. Another study showed that consuming 2 grams of green tea powder
      daily for two months helped improve brain function in elderly people (25).
      After drinking 2 grams of matcha green tea every day for 3 months, the
      participant’s mental state examination scores improved significantly*. If
      only we had Matcha in high school!
    </p>
    <h4>7. MATCHA FOR CALMNESS</h4>
    <p>
      L-theanine is a rare amino acid found in high concentrations in matcha
      that crosses the blood-brain barrier and promotes a feeling of relaxation
      while reducing mental and physical stress* (9). L-theanine works with
      caffeine to provide a stable extended boost of energy with none of the
      usual jittery side effects of caffeine and stimulants. It’s a mouthful,
      but l-theanine has a lot to do with the relaxed state of mind you
      experience when you’re on matcha. Fun fact - l-theanine also gives Tenzo
      matcha its subtle sweet flavor* (10).
    </p>
    <h4>8. ANTIOXIDANTS</h4>
    <p>
      Matcha Green Tea has the highest antioxidant rating of all major
      superfoods, and there’s even a test to prove it. According to The ORAC
      (Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity) test, which measures the antioxidant
      levels in foods, Matcha Green Tea measures 1384 units per gram* (2).
      That’s 13x the antioxidants of pomegranates, 15x the antioxidants of
      blueberries, and 125x that of spinach. Say hello to feeling invincible!
    </p>
    <h4>9. CATCH THE CATECHINS</h4>
    <p>
      Catechins are a rare group of molecules that have proven to be incredibly
      potent and beneficial antioxidants* (3). One Specific Catechin, called
      EGCg, makes up a large percentage of the total catechins in matcha green
      tea. This super molecule aids in weight loss and promotes a healthy brain
      and heart health. Matcha green tea and cocoa are the two best places to
      find catechins - Tenzo Tea and Chocolate!
    </p>
    <h4>10. MATCHA FOR ORAL HEALTH</h4>
    <p>
      90% of bad breath comes from bacterial cavities in your mouth. This is
      where bacteria breakdown sulfur-containing amino acids into foul-smelling
      volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) (16). If the bacterial colonies in your
      mouth get out of control, bad breath will begin to run wild. You don’t
      want that (and neither do we). Good news: When tested against gum, mints
      and other foods, green tea showed the largest reduction in the
      concentration of both H(2)S and CH(3)SH gases* (17). The antibacterial
      properties of green tea keep the bacteria (and your breath) at bay. Land
      ho.
      <br />
      GREEN TEA VS COFFEE?
      <br />
      Coffee is very acidic, which means bacteria reproduce faster than your
      morning commute (18). When you add milk, creamers and even non-dairy
      creamers to your coffee, the overgrowth of bacteria in your mouth
      continues to get worse. Matcha keeps your teeth strong and healthy. If you
      drink your matcha green it will help prevent the formation of cavities by
      preventing plaque build-up and inhibiting bacteria* (19). Find a dentist
      who wouldn’t recommend that.
    </p>
    <h4>11. MATCHA MAY HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT</h4>
    <p>
      Can you lose weight with matcha? Matcha contains EGCg (epigallocatechin
      gallate), which increases CCK (cholecystokinin), the hormone responsible
      for making you feel full* (12). Drinking matcha between meals will help
      you feel full and resist those sneaky snacks that are full of calories.
      Psst.. Sometimes we overeat when we’re cranky. Drinking matcha puts you in
      a better mood, makes you feel more relaxed and results in happiness. As a
      result of this phenomenon, you won’t need to snack or overeat to feel
      good.
    </p>
    <h4>12. O2 STRESS?</h4>
    <p>
      Oxidative stress is a real thing, and it occurs when oxygen-free radicals
      overwhelm the body and damage cells. This can lead to a wide range of
      illnesses and diseases including cancer, gene mutations, Parkinson’s
      disease, Alzheimer’s disease, heart attack and heart failure. The
      antioxidants in matcha actively seek out these molecules in the body and
      neutralize their harmful effects* (4)! It’s easy to prevent oxidative
      stress. Just be sure to have a constant supply of naturally occurring
      antioxidants in your diet. Anti-oxidants … Get it?
    </p>
    <h4>13. YOUR SKIN</h4>
    <p>
      One of the many green tea benefits has to do with the fact that matcha is
      great for your skin! You can even make a matcha face mask and use it in
      all sorts of ways for beauty and skin care. The catechins in green tea
      work to trap and deactivate free radicals in the skin, which slows down
      signs of aging. Applying matcha directly to the skin in the form of a mask
      is one of the best ways to fight acne and symptoms of rosacea* (5).
      <br />
      REDUCE REDNESS
      <br />
      Matcha powder has many anti-inflammatory properties*, especially EGCg,
      that reduce the redness associated with chronic skin conditions such as
      rosacea and acne. It is gentle enough for all skin types and brings
      soothing relief. Not only will your skin feel better, you’ll look better,
      too! Matcha diminishes redness, meaning you can walk out of your house
      with a face of confidence (6).
      <br />
      IMPROVE YOUR COMPLEXION
      <br />
      Matcha powder does crazy things to keep your complexion fresh and healthy.
      Not only does it reduce inflammation, it also offers a one-two punch for
      the skin to exfoliate and eliminate dead skin cells, then rejuvenate the
      underlying skin to improve your complexion. The only thing you’ll see is a
      better looking version of yourself!
      <br />
      “YOU LOOK GREAT!”
      <br />
      Thanks! That’s because matcha powder diminishes the signs of aging. Let’s
      face it. This is one of the biggest reasons we take care of our skin.
      Matcha protects against UV damage and improves skin elasticity* (7). It
      even stimulates elastin production to add volume to the skin and protects
      it against those free radicals cause sun damage, age spots, dry skin, and
      yes, wrinkles.

      <br />
      YOUR FACE IS NOT AN OIL REFINERY
      <br />
      And it doesn’t have to feel like one. Oily skin is one of the leading
      reasons why we have breakouts. The good news? Matcha treats oily skin. The
      tannins in matcha actually shrink pores and reduce the production of oil
      associated with acne. Matcha is especially beneficial as it removes oil
      from the skin and slows the production of the oil causing the acne.

      <br />
      ALL SKIN TYPES, WELCOME
      <br />
      Matcha masks are made from food, not chemicals, which makes it about the
      most natural skin care product out there. That’s why it is gentle enough
      for younger skin yet strong enough for skin that needs a little boost to
      look better. Not all heroes wear capes.
    </p>
    <h4>14. BETTER CHOLESTEROL</h4>
    <p>
      Studies of different populations revealed that people who drink Matcha
      green tea on a regular basis have lower levels of LDL (read: bad)
      cholesterol*, while at the same time displaying higher levels of HDL
      (read: good) cholesterol. HDL sweeps away bad cholesterol from arteries,
      preventing atherosclerosis. The clogged arteries that result from
      atherosclerosis can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Long story short,
      avoid LDLs. Proof: The first human study to show that green tea reduced
      LDL cholesterol was conducted by Vanderbilt University Medical Center in
      2003. During a 12-week trial, study participants took 375 mg capsules
      containing an extract of green tea. The levels of polyphenols in the
      capsules were equivalent to the amount found in 35 cups of green tea or
      3.5 cups of matcha. The results showed a 16 percent reduction in
      cholesterol* - even the researchers were surprised (15)!
    </p>
    <h4>15. DETOX</h4>
    <p>
      Matcha leaves are shade-grown and, when you throw shade at plants, they
      produce extra chlorophyll in their leaves. Green tea has powerful
      detoxifying properties and in some cases has the ability to naturally
      eliminate heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions* (1).
    </p>
    <h4>16. REMEMBER WHEN…?</h4>
    <p>
      Whatever it was, the answer is yes. A study performed by the University of
      Basel, Switzerland found that green tea increased the working memory
      performance of participants and increased the brain’s effective
      connectivity, leading to improvements in cognitive performance* (26). The
      results of the study showed that those who drank matcha performed better
      on the short-term memory tests and showed higher brain function in the
      frontal and parietal lobes of the brain. The frontal lobe is responsible
      for the majority of advanced thinking while the parietal lobe in the back
      of the brain handles the cognitive understanding of speech. The MRI scans
      revealed that those who drank matcha had more interaction between the two
      areas, boosting information recall and the speed of which they processed
      information.
    </p>

    <h4>17. YOUR BRAIN</h4>
    <p>
      Green tea polyphenols are now being considered therapeutic agents in
      well-controlled studies, aimed to alter brain aging processes and to serve
      as possible neuroprotective agents in progressive neurodegenerative
      disorders*. If that sounds clunky, here’s why it’s important: Those
      neurodegenerative disorder include Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases
      (27). And perhaps Matcha Tea can protect against them*.
    </p>
    <h4>18. MATCHA FOR ARTHRITIS</h4>
    <p>
      Matcha tea is one of the most-studied drinks when it comes to its benefits
      for arthritis patients. Green, black and white teas are all rich in
      polyphenols – compounds from plants that have strong anti-inflammatory
      effects* (28). Studies have shown that green tea also helps preserve
      cartilage and bone. Green tea has polyphenols, antioxidants believed to
      reduce inflammation and slow cartilage destruction. Studies also show that
      another antioxidant in green tea called epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg)
      blocks the production of molecules that cause joint damage in people with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Antioxidant-rich green tea may be useful in the
      prevention of onset and severity of arthritis* (29). Whether your wrist is
      sore, or you just don’t wait it to be, Good Matcha will be sure to make
      you feel better!
    </p>
    <h4>19. VITAMINS & MINERALS</h4>
    <p>
      Both are important, but a lot of us forget to take them. Tea is one of the
      most-studied drinks when it comes to its benefits for arthritis patients.
      Green, black and white teas are all rich in polyphenols – compounds from
      plants that have strong anti-inflammatory effects. Studies have shown that
      green tea also helps preserve cartilage and bone mass. Got tea?
      <br />
      VITAMIN A (CAROTENE)
      <br />
      Several types of carotene exist in tea leaves but B-Carotene is the most
      common. B-Carotene converts to Vitamin A once absorbed in the body and has
      shown to help promote better vision and eliminate free radicals with its
      strong effects as an antioxidant.

      <br />

      VITAMIN B1 (THIAMINE)
      <br />
      Thiamine is an essential nutrient because people are unable to produce it
      within the body. It’s necessary for the proper metabolism of sugar, amino
      acids, and lipids. Thiamine is especially important for people who depend
      on rice as their primary source of nutrition.

      <br />

      VITAMIN B2 (RIBOFLAVIN)
      <br />
      Riboflavin helps cells utilize oxygen most efficiently and is necessary
      for normal cell growth like red blood cell formation and antibody
      production. It also helps tissues of the skin, hair, nails, and hair
      utilize oxygen more efficiently.
      <br />

      VITAMIN B3 (NIACIN)
      <br />
      Niacin helps the body break down carbohydrates, fat, and proteins to
      release energy. In addition, it has a wide range of functions that serve
      to help the skin, digestive system, and the nervous system. Studies that
      show niacin can boost levels of good HDL cholesterol and lower
      triglycerides. There is also good evidence that it helps to reduce the
      hardening of arteries and can lower the risk of a heart attack.

      <br />

      VITAMIN C
      <br />
      Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant vitamin that
      eliminates free radicals from the body. It is an essential nutrient
      involved in the repair of tissue and the production of specific
      neurotransmitters. In addition, Vitamin C has antiviral and antibacterial
      properties that assist in preventing sickness and is important for a
      healthy immune system. Fermented teas (like black and oolong tea) contain
      far less Vitamin C because it is destroyed in the fermentation process.

      <br />

      VITAMIN F (FLUORINE)
      <br />
      Fluorine is particularly abundant in the Camellia family of plants. It
      adheres to the surface of teeth and produces an antioxidant coating that
      helps the fight against cavities.
      <br />

      VITAMIN P (FLAVONOIDS)
      <br />
      Tea is one of the most-studied drinks when it comes to its benefits for
      arthritis patients. Green, black and white teas are all rich in
      polyphenols – compounds from plants that have strong anti-inflammatory
      effects. Studies have shown that green tea also helps preserve cartilage
      and bone.

      <br />

    <h4>20. MATCHA IS EASY TO MAKE AND TASTES GREAT</h4>
    <p>
      Making Matcha couldn't be easier. The goal is to suspend your beautiful
      green tea powder with water. The best three ways to do this are with a
      bamboo whisk, a shaker bottle or blender. MATCHA LATTE: To make a matcha
      latte, start with a Tenzo shot and add your choice of milk to top it off.
      MATCHA LEMONADE: To make a Matcha Lemonade, start with a Tenzo shot, add
      some ice and fill your glass with lemonade. We put together a ton of easy
      matcha recipes that you can make in 5 minutes or less. You can find them
      here. We love matcha and hope you will too!
    </p>
    <h4>21. THE BEST MATCHA TASTES GREAT</h4>
    <p>
      Green is the embodiment of health, but just because matcha looks healthy
      doesn’t mean it has to taste like grass. Some teas require sugar, milk and
      lemon to make them drinkable, but the best matcha tea is wonderful on its
      own. Ceremonial matcha has a delicious vegetal flavor that is complemented
      by savory umami notes and tastes great both hot and over ice. So sit back,
      relax, and enjoy a delicious cup of matcha green tea.

    <h3>Recipe for Strawberry Matcha Latte</h3>
    <p>
      Start by macerating the strawberries. Use a fork to mix them with the
      sugar, lightly mashing them as you mix. Set them aside while you prepare
      the matcha.Next, prepare the matcha tea in two easy steps: Sift the matcha
      into a small bowl. High quality matcha likes to clump! The clumps are
      nothing to worry about—they’re totally normal especially with ceremonial
      grades. To break them up, it’s important to sift the matcha before mixing
      it with liquid. If you need, Matcha.com has a range of matcha tools –
      sifters, bamboo whisks, and more! Whisk the matcha with 1/4 cup water. Add
      the water to the bowl with the matcha and whisk vigorously from side to
      side—not in a circle. The lateral motion helps evenly disperse the tea in
      the water and create a foamy layer on top. A chasen, or bamboo matcha
      whisk, is traditionally used for this. To assemble the strawberry matcha
      latte, place the strawberries at the bottom of a large glass. Fill the
      glass halfway with ice, and then pour in enough milk to fill the glass
      two-thirds of the way full. Finally, pour the matcha tea on top. Stir with
      a straw and taste. If you’d like the strawberry matcha latte to be
      sweeter, add honey or maple syrup as desired. Enjoy!
